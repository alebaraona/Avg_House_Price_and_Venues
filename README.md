# Average House Price and Most Common Venues in Dublin

## Background
Dublin is the capital and largest city of Ireland. The population of Dublin is approximately 1.4 million and the population density is 4,811/km2. The city is divided into 22 districts that are enumerated from 1 to 24, the south side comprises the even-number districts, which are from 2 to 24 and 6W, and the north part has the odd-number districts, which are from 1 to 17. [1]

According to Mercer’s cost of living survey, Dublin is the most expensive city for expatriates in the Eurozone and the 46th most expensive country out of 209 cities. The cost of rental accommodation was named one of the main reasons for the high cost of living. [2]

The city residents will naturally prefer regions in which the cost of renting is lower and where the neighbourhood most fit their lifestyle. From the investor perspective, it’s expected that they also prefer districts where the real estate cost is lower and the kind of business, they want to create is less intense.
Typically, the cost of renting is a small percentage of the house market price, therefore, analysing the average house price per district can indicate the average rental price.

Taking all of that into account, the project aim to develop a map and an information chart informing the average house price and the most common venues per district to assist investors and residents in making their decisions either on where to invest or to live.
