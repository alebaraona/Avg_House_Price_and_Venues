    "# Medical Centre in Dublin\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "As a recent Dublin resident, it's hard to find a medical centre that is not full of patients and accepts to attend you, and most of the walk-in clinics are in the city centre. In case of sickness many people need to go straight to hospitals and travel to downtown in order to find a doctor. Thus, medical centres can be a profitable business in the city.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project's goal is to find out what is the best district to open a medical centre.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Source\n",
    "The data will be obtained from scrapping the website https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Dublin_postal_districts and the coordinates will acquired from geocoder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Four Square API will be used to get existing medical centre in the districts of Dublin."
